# Deployment Fix for TypeScript Build Error

## Problem
The deployment was failing because Coolify was trying to run `npm run build` which executed `tsc` (TypeScript compiler), but this is a JavaScript project without TypeScript configuration.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated package.json**: Changed the build script from `"build": "tsc"` to `"build": "echo 'No build step required for JavaScript project'"`
2. **Removed unnecessary TypeScript dependencies**: Removed `@types/node` and `typescript` from devDependencies
3. **Optimized Dockerfile**: Improved the Dockerfile for JavaScript projects
4. **Added .nvmrc**: Specified Node.js version 18 for consistency

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated build script and removed TypeScript deps
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized for JavaScript project
- `.nvmrc` - Added Node.js version specification

## What to do next
1. **Commit and push** these changes to your repository
2. **Redeploy** in Coolify - the build should now succeed
3. **Test the deployment** by visiting your health check endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/health`

## Verification
After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Build completes successfully (no more TypeScript errors)
- ✅ Health check endpoint responds with status 200
- ✅ All API endpoints work correctly

The deployment should now work without the TypeScript compilation error!
